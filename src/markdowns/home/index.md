overview:
  body: >-
    I’m a developer passionate about crafting accessible, pixel-perfect user
    interfaces that blend thoughtful design with robust engineering.



    My favorite work lives at the intersection of design and development—creating experiences that not only look great but are meticulously built for performance and usability. 



    Currently, I'm a Front-End Engineer at Betrnk, specializing in development. I help design, build, and maintain the UI components that power Betrnk's frontend, ensuring our platform meets web accessibility standards and best practices to deliver an inclusive user experience.



    In the past, I’ve developed CMS projects for international clients and built software across agencies, companies, and businesses in industries ranging from digital media to tech. 
projects:
  - body: >-
      **Daimasu** is a high-end Japanese dining establishment in the
      Philippines. I created their website entirely through AI-assisted
      development, using **Figma MCP** and **Claude** to transform design files
      directly into production-ready code—without writing code manually. This
      approach demonstrated how AI tooling can streamline the
      design-to-development pipeline while maintaining high standards for
      performance and user experience.




      Claude accelerated development by generating well-structured boilerplate and applying modern web development best practices automatically—from performance optimizations and rendering strategies to component architecture and data fetching patterns. The AI consistently produced clean, maintainable code that required minimal manual refinement, showcasing how AI can handle the full spectrum of frontend development tasks.

      sections, and snippets. Customizations include tailored Liquid template
      logic, custom CSS/SCSS styling, and JavaScript enhancements integrated
      within Shopify's theme structure. The theme leverages Shopify's section
      schema for merchant-configurable components while maintaining
      compatibility with Shopify's Online Store 2.0 framework.

      The Cage System is an internal project management and operations dashboard
      developed for streamlining workflows within Betrnk’s junket management
      ecosystem. As part of the frontend engineering team, I helped design and
      implement a dynamic interface that consolidates complex data and
      access-controlled operations into a single, intuitive platform.


      I was responsible for building modular, responsive UI components using Next.js and Tailwind CSS, integrated with Zustand for state management and React Hook Form for flexible form workflows. The system supports role-based access, dynamic permissions, and authenticated routing using NextAuth allowing secure and personalized access across multiple user tiers.

      coordination, and terminal logistics — ultimately enhancing operational
      efficiency and regulatory compliance across the organization. Transport
      OPS is integrated with **LogiNext**, enabling features like optimized
      route planning, real-time GPS tracking of trucks, and automated status
      updates for container movements."

      remaining easy to maintain through a lightweight content management
      system.
