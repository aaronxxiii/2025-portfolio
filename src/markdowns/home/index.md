overview:
  body: >-
    I’m a developer passionate about crafting accessible, pixel-perfect user
    interfaces that blend thoughtful design with robust engineering.



    My favorite work lives at the intersection of design and development—creating experiences that not only look great but are meticulously built for performance and usability. 



    Currently, I'm a Front-End Engineer at Betrnk, specializing in development. I help design, build, and maintain the UI components that power Betrnk's frontend, ensuring our platform meets web accessibility standards and best practices to deliver an inclusive user experience.



    In the past, I’ve developed CMS projects for international clients and built software across agencies, startups, and businesses in industries ranging from digital media to tech.

    title: Front End Developer
    body: It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the
      readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using
      Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters,
      as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like
      readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors
      now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem
      ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.
