overview:
  body: >-
    I’m a developer passionate about crafting accessible, pixel-perfect user
    interfaces that blend thoughtful design with robust engineering.



    My favorite work lives at the intersection of design and development—creating experiences that not only look great but are meticulously built for performance and usability. 



    Currently, I'm a Front-End Engineer at Betrnk, specializing in development. I help design, build, and maintain the UI components that power Betrnk's frontend, ensuring our platform meets web accessibility standards and best practices to deliver an inclusive user experience.



    In the past, I’ve developed CMS projects for international clients and built software across agencies, companies, and businesses in industries ranging from digital media to tech. 
projects:
  - body: >-
      **Daimasu** is a high-end Japanese dining establishment in the
      Philippines. I created their website entirely through AI-assisted
      development, using **Figma MCP** and **Claude** to transform design files
      directly into production-ready code—without writing code manually. This
      approach demonstrated how AI tooling can streamline the
      design-to-development pipeline while maintaining high standards for
      performance and user experience.



      Claude accelerated development by generating well-structured boilerplate and applying modern web development best practices automatically—from performance optimizations and rendering strategies to component architecture and data fetching patterns. The AI consistently produced clean, maintainable code that required minimal manual refinement, showcasing how AI can handle the full spectrum of frontend development tasks.

    title: Betrnk Cage
    body: >-
      The Cage System is an internal project management and operations dashboard
      developed for streamlining workflows within Betrnk’s junket management
      ecosystem. As part of the frontend engineering team, I helped design and
      implement a dynamic interface that consolidates complex data and
      access-controlled operations into a single, intuitive platform.


      I was responsible for building modular, responsive UI components using Next.js and Tailwind CSS, integrated with Zustand for state management and React Hook Form for flexible form workflows. The system supports role-based access, dynamic permissions, and authenticated routing using NextAuth allowing secure and personalized access across multiple user tiers.

      system designed to streamline and digitize daily transport operations
      within **SpanAsia**. The platform’s core purpose is to provide real-time
      visibility and centralized control over container movement, fleet
      coordination, and terminal logistics — ultimately enhancing operational
      efficiency and regulatory compliance across the organization. Transport
      OPS is integrated with **LogiNext**, enabling features like optimized
      route planning, real-time GPS tracking of trucks, and automated status
      updates for container movements."

      Philippine Span Asia Carrier Corporation (PSACC), a leading domestic
      shipping line in the Philippines. The goal of the project was to build a
      fast, accessible, and visually cohesive website that communicates the
      company’s services, vessel schedules, and shipping operations while
      remaining easy to maintain through a lightweight content management
      system.


      I led the creation of a custom design system using Radix UI primitives, before the emergence of frameworks like ShadCN.

    body: The goal of the project was to provide JFE’s regional offices in Malaysia
      and Vietnam with fast, secure, and easily maintainable websites that
      aligned with JFE’s global brand. Each site serves as a digital portal for
      sharing corporate information, showcasing services, and enabling
      communication with local clients and partners. Given the multinational
      scope, the websites were developed with multilingual support and optimized
      for performance and scalability.
