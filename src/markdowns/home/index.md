overview:
  body: >-
    I’m a developer passionate about crafting accessible, pixel-perfect user
    interfaces that blend thoughtful design with robust engineering.



    My favorite work lives at the intersection of design and development—creating experiences that not only look great but are meticulously built for performance and usability. 



    Currently, I'm a Front-End Engineer at Betrnk, specializing in development. I help design, build, and maintain the UI components that power Betrnk's frontend, ensuring our platform meets web accessibility standards and best practices to deliver an inclusive user experience.



    In the past, I’ve developed CMS projects for international clients and built software across agencies, companies, and businesses in industries ranging from digital media to tech.

    body: I played a hands-on role in the end-to-end development of various web
      applications, collaborating across multiple teams to deliver high-quality,
      functional, and visually consistent web experiences. I contributed to the
      design, implementation, testing, and optimization of features across
      several projects, each with unique goals and requirements. Working in a
      dynamic and fast-paced environment, I frequently interacted with
      designers, backend developers, QA engineers, and product stakeholders to
      ensure technical alignment, design fidelity, and user satisfaction.

    title: Associate Software Engineer
    body: Worked alongside student designers and engineers to develop and enhance
      school aide platforms. Integrated third-party APIs, including Paymongo for
      secure payment processing, and implemented features such as user data
      fetching, dynamic content rendering and responsive design. Contributed to
      full-stack development with a focus on API integration, code
      maintainability, and user experience.

  - body: "**Daimasu** is a high-end Japanese dining establishment in the
      Philippines, I played a key role in optimizing the website’s performance,
      user experience, and internationalization. I implemented custom local font
      loading via `next/font/local`, paired with precise fallback strategies and
      layout constraints to eliminate layout shifts and improve Core Web Vitals
      such as **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**. To further enhance perceived
      speed and load performance, I applied server-side rendering and static
      generation techniques using Next.js, reducing **Time to First Byte
      (TTFB)** and improving **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**. For dynamic
      user interaction, I integrated **SWR Infinite** to power a load-on-scroll
      experience in the menu section, enabling seamless pagination of food items
      without full page reloads — a feature especially useful on mobile. I also
      implemented **multilingual support** using `next-intl.`"

    title: Betrnk Cage
    body: >-
      The Cage System is an internal project management and operations dashboard
      developed for streamlining workflows within Betrnk’s junket management
      ecosystem. As part of the frontend engineering team, I helped design and
      implement a dynamic interface that consolidates complex data and
      access-controlled operations into a single, intuitive platform.


      I was responsible for building modular, responsive UI components using Next.js and Tailwind CSS, integrated with Zustand for state management and React Hook Form for flexible form workflows. The system supports role-based access, dynamic permissions, and authenticated routing using NextAuth allowing secure and personalized access across multiple user tiers.

      coordination, and terminal logistics — ultimately enhancing operational
      efficiency and regulatory compliance across the organization. Transport
      OPS is integrated with **LogiNext**, enabling features like optimized
      route planning, real-time GPS tracking of trucks, and automated status
      updates for container movements."

      Philippine Span Asia Carrier Corporation (PSACC), a leading domestic
      shipping line in the Philippines. The goal of the project was to build a
      fast, accessible, and visually cohesive website that communicates the
      company’s services, vessel schedules, and shipping operations while
      remaining easy to maintain through a lightweight content management
      system.


      I led the creation of a custom design system using Radix UI primitives, before the emergence of frameworks like ShadCN.

      and Vietnam with fast, secure, and easily maintainable websites that
      aligned with JFE’s global brand. Each site serves as a digital portal for
      sharing corporate information, showcasing services, and enabling
      communication with local clients and partners. Given the multinational
      scope, the websites were developed with multilingual support and optimized
      for performance and scalability.
